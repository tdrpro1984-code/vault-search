> *Vault Search helps you **search by meaning** and **rediscover forgotten notes**.*

No cloud services. No API keys. No subscription fees. Your notes never leave your machine.

![Search Panel](./docs/search-panel.png)

## Why Vault Search?

[Andrej Karpathy shared](https://venturebeat.com/data/karpathy-shares-llm-knowledge-base-architecture-that-bypasses-rag-with-an/) his vision of LLM-maintained knowledge bases — letting AI "compile" your notes into a structured wiki. It's a compelling approach, but it assumes you're ready to hand full editorial control to an LLM.

**Vault Search takes a different stance.** AI should help you *see*, not think for you. The best tool doesn't replace your writing — it helps you **rediscover** what you already know, and surfaces connections you missed.

### What sets Vault Search apart

**Discover, not organize** — Other tools build AI wikis or auto-summaries. Vault Search finds the notes *you* should be looking at. The Discover tab shows related notes you haven't connected yet — especially Cold (isolated) notes hiding in your vault.

**Hot/Cold intelligence** — Notes with links or recent activity are Hot. Orphan notes are Cold. Discover surfaces Cold notes that are semantically related to your current thinking — your blind spots become visible.

**MOC generation** — One click turns search or discover results into a Map of Content note with wikilinks and previews. You decide the structure; AI just gathers the pieces.

**Truly local, truly private** — All embedding, indexing, search, and discovery happen on your machine. Zero data leaves your computer. This isn't a toggle; it's the architecture.

**Simple and fast** — Sidebar panel with Search and Discover tabs. Cmd/Ctrl+P for instant modal search. Right-click results for Obsidian's native file menu. Drag results to Canvas for visual mapping.

**Optimized for Chinese** — Built with `qwen3-embedding:0.6b`, which excels at Traditional Chinese + English semantic understanding. Combined with synonym expansion, even different phrasings of the same concept will match.

**LLM-powered descriptions** — A local LLM generates frontmatter descriptions for your notes, giving the embedding model a high-quality summary to work with. This dramatically improves search and Discover relevance for long notes.

**Runs on 8GB laptops** — Minimal memory and CPU footprint. Recommended models work on a MacBook M2 with 8GB RAM. Incremental indexing + debounce means near-zero overhead in daily use.

**Flexible and compatible** — Works with Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM, or any OpenAI-compatible server. Choose the models that work best for your language and hardware.

> *"AI helps you see. You decide what it means."*

## What makes Vault Search different

Semantic search plugins in the Obsidian ecosystem generally stop at "find what you mean" — a smarter search box. Vault Search treats search as a starting point, not the destination. A quick tour of what that unlocks:

| Capability | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Discover tab, not just a search modal** | Opens a persistent sidebar that keeps surfacing related notes as you read and write — no command, no query, no interruption. |
| **Hot / Cold tiering** | Every note is automatically classified by linkage and recency. Cold (orphan) notes get surfaced next to your Hot ones, turning your forgotten vault into a living backlog. |
| **LLM-generated descriptions** | A local LLM writes a concise frontmatter description for each note so the embedding model works on curated summaries, not raw body text. Search and Discover quality improves noticeably on long notes. |
| **One-click MOC generation** | Turn any search or Discover result set into a Map of Content note with wikilinks and previews. Useful for research, weekly reviews, and writing outlines. |
| **Chinese-native from day one** | Tuned for `qwen3-embedding`, with synonym expansion, title keyword boost, and a bilingual UI. Traditional Chinese + English queries work out of the box. |
| **Clean, incremental index** | The index lives outside your notes — no stray CSVs in your vault root. File changes re-index automatically in the background. |
| **Canvas & right-click integration** | Drag results onto Canvas for visual mapping; right-click for Obsidian's native file menu (bookmark, rename, reveal). Search results feel like first-class Obsidian citizens. |
| **Fully local, fully private** | Embedding, indexing, search, and descriptions all run on your machine via Ollama or any OpenAI-compatible server. No cloud, no keys required, no telemetry. |

If you just want a better search box, plenty of options exist. Vault Search is for people who want their vault to *talk back*.

- **Bilingual UI** — English & Traditional Chinese (auto-detected)

## Requirements

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running
- An embedding model (e.g., `ollama pull qwen3-embedding:0.6b`)
- An LLM model for description generation (e.g., `ollama pull qwen3:1.7b`) (optional)
- Obsidian desktop

## Installation

### BRAT (recommended while pending community review)

1. Install [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin
2. Add this repository: `notoriouslab/vault-search`
3. Enable "Vault Search" in Community plugins

### Manual

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/notoriouslab/vault-search/releases)
2. Copy to `.obsidian/plugins/vault-search/` in your vault
3. Enable in Settings → Community plugins

> **Note:** If your vault is tracked by Git, add `.obsidian/plugins/*/data.json` to `.gitignore` to avoid accidentally committing API keys or personal settings.

## Quick Start

1. **Settings → Vault Search** → Select your embedding model
2. Click **Rebuild** to index your vault
3. **Cmd/Ctrl+P → "Semantic search"** or click the compass icon
4. Switch to the **Discover** tab to see related notes for the current file

### Recommended Workflow

```
1. Generate descriptions  →  2. Rebuild index  →  3. Search & Discover
   (LLM summarizes notes)    (embed with descriptions)   (find and rediscover)
```

**Why this order?** The indexer uses frontmatter `description` preferentially for embedding. Descriptions first → better search and Discover quality.

- **Minimal setup**: Skip step 1, just Rebuild and search.
- **Best quality**: **Generate descriptions (preview)** → review → **Apply** → **Rebuild index**.

### Discover Workflow

The Discover tab has two modes:

- **Current note** — Shows notes related to whatever you're reading. Cold notes are highlighted — these are your blind spots.
- **Global** — Shows Cold notes most related to your entire Hot pool. Great for finding forgotten gems after importing lots of files.

Click **Generate MOC** to export results as a linked note.

```

1. **Index** — Note content (or description) → embedding model → vector stored in `index.json`
2. **Search** — Query (+ synonym expansion) → same model → cosine similarity → ranked results
3. **Discover** — No API calls. Compares existing embeddings to surface related Cold notes
4. **Hot/Cold** — Linked/recent = Hot. Orphan = Cold. Discover highlights Cold notes in your blind spot
5. **MOC** — Export results as a Map of Content note with wikilinks and previews
6. **Descriptions** — Local LLM summarizes notes → stored in frontmatter → used for better embeddings

## Recommended Models

| Model | Size | Use | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen3-embedding:0.6b` | 639MB | Embedding | Best for Chinese + English |
| `nomic-embed-text` | 274MB | Embedding | Lighter, English-focused |
| `qwen3:1.7b` | 1.4GB | LLM | Good quality, handles 2000+ chars |
| `gemma3:1b` | 815MB | LLM | Lighter, but unstable > 500 chars input |

> For 8GB RAM machines, use `qwen3-embedding:0.6b` + `qwen3:1.7b`. Both fit comfortably.
