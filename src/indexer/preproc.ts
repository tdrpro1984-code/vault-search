/**
 * preproc — Traditional→Simplified conversion for embedding input (008).
 *
 * Why: bge-small-zh is trained predominantly on Simplified Chinese.
 * Converting the EMBEDDING INPUT (never the stored text, BM25 corpus, LLM
 * prompts, or anything user-visible) moves vectors into the model's
 * best-trained token space. Measured on the dogfood vault
 * (openspec/research/2026-07-18-s2t-embedding-pilot.md): positives hold or
 * improve, unrelated hub notes drop 3-4x in rank, template similarity −0.03.
 *
 * Scope discipline (design 008 D3): exactly four call sites convert —
 * indexOne chunk embeds, indexOne description embed, backfill description
 * embeds, and the search query embed. The LLM path (description generator)
 * MUST stay Traditional: converting it would write Simplified descriptions
 * back into the vault.
 *
 * T2S_VERSION is bound to the generated table (t2sTable.ts) — regenerating
 * the table MUST bump it; the upgrade re-embed scan in Indexer.update()
 * keys off this value, same pattern as DENOISE_VERSION.
